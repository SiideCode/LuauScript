# LuauScript

LuauScript is a Haxe-like/ActionScript 3.0-like interpreted language in very early stages of development with a compiler, and in the future (when byte buffer gets out of studio beta) a VM written in Luau for Roblox.

It is currently planned for it to be able to be precompiled (into bytecode), and then fed to the VM, or compiled when required (for example, before the script is executed, kind of like JavaScript in traditional VMs).


Main modules completion:

- Lexer: ~70%
- Parser: ~1%
- Bytecode Generator: not started
- VM: not started
