# LuauScript

## Info

Please note that I don't know what I'm doing!! (silly!!!)

LuauScript is an interpreted language in very early stages of development with a work-in-progress compiler, and in the future a VM, written in Luau for Roblox.

The language is inspired by Haxe and ActionScript (mainly), Lua and Luau (very slightly), and Rust (only some preprocessing and macro features), made for Roblox experiences to be user-moddable, allowing users to create content for your game and be creative.

It's currently planned for it to be able to be built entirely before execution (like java), or for each script to be built right before use, if needed (kinda like python/lua/js).

It's also planned to make a transpiler for it in the future, to make it usable in Roblox experience development, like [roblox-ts](https://github.com/roblox-ts/roblox-ts), allowing you to use a programming language with an actually sane type system for roblox development. It's currently a low priority goal, because the main goal of the language at the moment, which is convinient roblox experience modding, is not yet accomplished.

## Main modules completion (in order of priority)
